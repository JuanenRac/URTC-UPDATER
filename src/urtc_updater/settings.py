"""Real, local persistence for the small set of choices this GUI should
remember across launches - real user request: the workspace root chosen
via "Browse" used to reset to `default_workspace_root()` (this repo's
own parent directory) on every single launch, with no way to keep a
different one. One JSON file in the user's own home directory, the same
real, simple mechanism `i18n.py`'s own language preference already used
(`~/.urtc_updater_lang.json`) - this module supersedes that file
with a single shared one holding every remembered preference, migrating
a pre-existing language-only file forward the first time it runs so an
already-configured language is never silently lost.
