"""One line of evidence for every install or update attempt: which project,
what was installed before, what is installed now, at which commit, and
whether the attempt succeeded. Appended to a JSON-lines file in the
workspace, so a failed or interrupted attempt leaves a trace and a
successful one can be checked later. Recording never raises: a problem
writing the record must not turn a good update into a failed one."""
