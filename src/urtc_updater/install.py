# Deliberately does NOT reimplement per-stack build logic (npm/cargo/go/
# gradlew/flutter/pip, 7 different toolchains across the ecosystem). Every
# project carries the common non-versioning build-test.sh/.bat entry point.
# It delegates to its own stack-aware check without incrementing a manifest or
# CHANGELOG, so fleet maintenance cannot manufacture a release merely by
# refreshing a checkout. Versioned build scripts remain an explicit human
# release action and are never selected here. The shared build-test entry point
# already knows its own real
# dependencies, venv/toolchain setup, and quirks (HYDRA-UMC-TELEMETRY-
# COLLECTOR/HYDRA-UMC-TOOL-CLI's module root being src/, not the repo
# root, for instance). Reimplementing that here would mean two places that
# both claim to know how to build a given project, guaranteed to drift.
# This module's own job ends at "clone/pull the source, then run whichever
# build script this specific checkout actually has."

# and clone_or_pull's own promotion step below), and a crash between
# promoting and checking is itself recoverable via
